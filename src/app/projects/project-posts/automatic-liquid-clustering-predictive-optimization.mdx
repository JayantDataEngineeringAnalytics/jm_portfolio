Modernized table layout by enabling **Automatic Liquid Clustering (ALC)** with **Predictive Optimization** on Unity Catalog–managed Delta tables; replaced rigid partitions/Z‑ORDER with **self‑tuning clustering** and **Auto Optimize**, cutting scan time and small‑file overhead.

---

## Context / Problem

Growing data and mixed query patterns (multi‑tenant joins, range filters on event dates) made static partitioning costly and fragile. Daily OPTIMIZE/Z‑ORDER jobs were expensive and often out of sync with actual workload.

**Goals**

* Let the platform **learn and adapt** clustering keys automatically
* Reduce **scan time** and **shuffle** without maintaining partitions
* Keep file health with **optimizeWrite/autoCompact**
* Work natively under **Unity Catalog** with clear lineage and grants

**Assumptions (dummy details)**

* Azure Databricks, **DBR 15.4 LTS+** for ALC
* **Unity Catalog–managed** Delta tables in `sales_silver` and `sales_gold`
* Predictive Optimization **enabled** at the metastore/warehouse level

---

## My Role

* **Data Platform Architect & Implementer**
* Identified candidate tables, rolled out ALC, tuned write paths, and built the telemetry dashboard for file health & skipped bytes

---

## Architecture (Target)

* **Bronze**: ingestion as‑is (streaming/batch); minimal table services
* **Silver/Gold**: **ALC enabled**; Predictive Optimization maintains layout asynchronously
* **Write hygiene**: **Auto Optimize** (optimizeWrite + autoCompact) on curated tables
* **Observability**: table health metrics (avg file size, small‑file ratio, skipped bytes, scan time)

**Flow:** Ingest → Curate to managed Delta → **ALC + Auto Optimize** maintain layout → BI/ML queries benefit automatically

---

## Why ALC over Partitioning

* No directory explosion; layout adapts to **real predicates** over time
* Can **change keys** without table rewrites; platform converges automatically
* Plays well with **streaming** and mixed predicates (e.g., `tenant_id` + `event_date`)

---

## Rollout Plan

1. **Select candidates**: large tables with high scan time, many small files, frequent filters/joins
2. **Pre‑checks**: confirm UC‑managed, protocol OK, Predictive Optimization available
3. **Enable ALC** (`CLUSTER BY AUTO`) on targets
4. **Enable/verify Auto Optimize** on write paths
5. **Measure**: before/after (scan time, skipped bytes, avg file size, job latency)
6. **Expand** to more tables; remove legacy daily OPTIMIZE/Z‑ORDER where validated

---

## Implementation Examples

### Create managed schemas (UC)

```sql
CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS sales
  MANAGED LOCATION 'abfss://uc-managed@<acct>.dfs.core.windows.net/sales';
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS sales_silver;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS sales_gold;
```

### Turn on Automatic Liquid Clustering

```sql
-- New table with ALC
CREATE TABLE sales_silver.orders
USING DELTA
AS SELECT * FROM source.orders
CLUSTER BY AUTO;  -- Predictive Optimization chooses & maintains keys

-- Existing table: switch on ALC
ALTER TABLE sales_silver.events CLUSTER BY AUTO;
```

**Notes**: ALC requires **Predictive Optimization** enabled; the platform analyzes query history and adjusts keys when benefits outweigh costs. You can still revert or explicitly set keys later with `CLUSTER BY (col1, col2)` if needed.

### Write‑path hygiene (Auto Optimize)

```sql
ALTER TABLE sales_silver.orders SET TBLPROPERTIES (
  delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite = true,
  delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact  = true
);
```

### Streaming sink stays simple

```python
(spark.readStream.table("bronze.orders")
  .writeStream
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/Volumes/platform/chk/sales/orders_silver")
  .toTable("sales_silver.orders"))
# ALC + Predictive Optimization maintain layout asynchronously
```

### Health checks (examples)

```sql
-- Avg file size (MB)
SELECT AVG(size_bytes)/1024/1024 AS avg_mb
FROM system.storage.files
WHERE table_name = 'sales_silver.orders';

-- 7‑day read performance snapshot
SELECT avg(duration_ms) AS avg_ms
FROM system.query
WHERE object = 'sales_silver.orders' AND start_time >= current_date() - 7;
```

---

## Testing & Validation

* **Performance**: wall‑clock latency (batch/stream), scan time ↓, skipped bytes ↑
* **Files**: fewer tiny files; avg file size in target band (128–512MB)
* **Correctness**: row counts and checksums match pre‑ALC baselines
* **Cost**: fewer cluster hours for heavy queries; OPTIMIZE jobs retired where safe

---

## Outcomes / Impact

* **Query time**: −20–45% on high‑read tables
* **Ops**: removed daily OPTIMIZE/Z‑ORDER for selected tables; hands‑off maintenance
* **Flexibility**: layout adjusts as query patterns evolve—no rewrites

---

## Risks & Mitigations

* **PO not available in region** → fall back to manual `CLUSTER BY (keys)` until available
* **Write bursts** → ensure autoscaling; monitor checkpoint lag (for streaming)
* **Residual small files** → occasional housekeeping window if needed (rare with Auto Optimize)

---

## Runbook

* Confirm UC‑managed + DBR 15.4 LTS+
* Enable Predictive Optimization; validate on representative warehouse/jobs
* `ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER BY AUTO`
* Turn on table‑level Auto Optimize
* Add health monitors; compare before/after; expand rollout
