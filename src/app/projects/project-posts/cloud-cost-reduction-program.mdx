**Summary:** Enterprise **FinOps architecture & execution initiative** converting cost and recommendation signals into governed policies, reservations, rightsizing, lifecycle automation, and tracked savings across Azure subscriptions.

---

## Context / Problem

With cost and Advisor signals available from the analytics platform, this initiative established the **operating architecture and rollout plan** to systematically reduce spend across subscriptions while preserving SLAs.

**Assumptions (dummy details)**

* Multiple Azure subscriptions; tags: `env`, `app`, `owner` (varied quality)
* Mix of services: VMs, AKS, Databricks, Synapse, SQL DB, Storage, Functions
* Business cadence: monthly planning; weekly execution; quarterly review

---

## My Role

* **Program Lead (FinOps)**
* Owned prioritization, stakeholder alignment, change control, and rollout
* Drove weekly savings sprints and tracked realized vs potential savings

---

## Operating Architecture & Model

* **FinOps Council**: engineering + platform + finance; meets weekly
* **Owner of Record** per app/resource group; accountable for actions
* **Action Tracker** (existing table) used as single source of truth for status & realized savings
* **Change Windows** aligned to release calendar to avoid SLA risk

---

## Key Decisions & Patterns

* **Impact** (estimated monthly saving) × **Confidence** (data quality & feasibility) ÷ **Effort** (hours/risk)
* **Quick Wins** first (idle/duplicate/oversized) → **Commitments** (RIs/Savings Plans) → **Structural** (architecture patterns)
* Guardrails: exclude prod tier‑1 during peak seasons; pilot in **dev/uat** first

---

## Implementation Plan

### Wave 1 — Quick Wins (2–3 weeks)

* **Auto‑shutdown schedules** for non‑prod VMs, Synapse DWUs, and Databricks clusters
* **Idle resource cleanup**: unattached disks, stale public IPs/NICs, orphaned snapshots, unused load balancers
* **Databricks cluster policies**: min/max nodes, **auto‑termination**, Photon default, spot %, pool usage
* **Storage lifecycle rules**: Hot→Cool/Archive tiers; delete expired temp/stage containers; cap replication where not required

### Wave 2 — Rightsizing (3–4 weeks)

* **VM SKU downgrades** & scale set policies based on 95th percentile CPU/RAM
* **SQL DB / Synapse** service‑level adjustments; paused DWUs in off hours
* **Databricks**: right‑size node families; tune autoscale bounds; enforce `optimizeWrite/autoCompact`
* **AKS**: node pool consolidation, spot for batch, HPA/VPA tuning

### Wave 3 — Commitments & Purchasing (1–2 weeks)

* **Reserved Instances / Savings Plans** for stable 12–36m baseload (compute, SQL)
* **Capacity recommendations** converted to purchase orders; staged by environment
* **SLA checks** and back‑out plans documented prior to commit

### Wave 4 — Structural & Policy (ongoing)

* **Tag enforcement** via Azure Policy; deny‑without‑tag with exception flow
* **Budget alerts** per sub/RG/app; anomaly alerts
* **Golden patterns**: serverless/event‑driven where feasible; ephemeral dev envs
* **Data lifecycle**: shorten retention on bronze/intermediate; delete derived temp tables

---

## Controls & Governance

* **Exceptions registry** (business‑critical/no‑scale systems)
* **CAB** review for high‑impact changes (prod compute cuts, commitment buys)
* **SLO monitoring**: ensure p95 latency/error budgets unaffected
* **Audit**: change logs linked to realized savings rows

---

## RACI (Abbrev.)

* **FinOps Lead** (Accountable): backlog, prioritization, reporting to finance
* **Platform Eng** (Responsible): policies, reservations, cross‑cutting automations
* **App Teams** (Responsible): service‑level rightsizing & schedules
* **Security/Compliance** (Consulted): policy exceptions, data retention
* **Finance** (Informed): purchasing approvals, savings realization

---

## Testing & Validation

* **Pilot environments**: test all changes in dev/uat before production rollout
* **SLO monitoring**: continuous tracking of p95 latency and error budgets
* **Savings validation**: monthly reconciliation of realized vs estimated savings
* **Rollback procedures**: documented back‑out plans for all high‑impact changes

---

## Outcomes / Impact

* **Compute**: −18–30% in non‑prod; −10–15% in prod baseline via rightsizing
* **Storage**: −25% hot storage via lifecycle policies; archive cold data
* **Databricks**: −20–35% DBU spend via cluster policies + spot + Photon
* **Commitments**: 1–3 year plans covering 50–70% of steady load
* **Confidence**: SLA/SLO unchanged post‑change windows

---

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Over‑aggressive rightsizing** → protect with p95 + buffer; canary first
* **Tag drift** → enforce policy; nightly compliance report to owners
* **Commitment lock‑in** → staged purchases, conservative coverage %, resale options
* **Change fatigue** → batch changes per app; publish calendar and back‑out steps

---

## Artifacts

* **Action Tracker** (owner, resource\_id, change, est\_save, realized\_save, status, opened/closed)
* **Runbooks**: VM/DB/Databricks rightsizing, storage lifecycle, schedule creation
* **Approvals**: RI/Savings Plan justification sheets
* **Meeting cadence**: weekly council notes and decision logs
