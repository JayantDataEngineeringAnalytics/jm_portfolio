## Overview

This demo showcases a complete real-time data pipeline architecture that processes streaming data from multiple sources, applies transformations, and stores the results in a Delta Lake for analytics.

## Architecture Components

The pipeline consists of several key components:

- **Apache Kafka**: Message streaming platform for real-time data ingestion
- **Apache Spark Streaming**: Stream processing engine for real-time transformations
- **Delta Lake**: ACID-compliant data lake storage with versioning capabilities
- **Databricks**: Unified analytics platform for data processing and ML

## Live Demo Features

### Data Ingestion
- Real-time sensor data simulation
- Multi-format data support (JSON, Avro, Parquet)
- Schema validation and error handling

### Stream Processing
- Window-based aggregations
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Data quality checks and cleansing

### Storage & Analytics
- ACID transactions with Delta Lake
- Time travel capabilities
- Real-time dashboard updates

## Key Metrics

- **Throughput**: 10,000+ events/second
- **Latency**: Sub-second processing
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Storage**: Optimized with Z-ordering

## Technology Stack

Built using modern data engineering tools and best practices for scalability and reliability.
